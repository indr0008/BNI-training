#-p: This option is used to create parent directories as needed. If a directory's parent directories don't exist, the -p option ensures that they are created as well.
hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/hive/warehouse

#-chmod: This option is used to change the permissions of files and directories.
#g+w: This part of the command specifies the changes to be made to the permissions. In this case, it adds write (w) permission to the group (g) of the specified file or directory.

hadoop fs -chmod g+w /user/hive/warehouse

#echo: This is a command that is used to display a message or output to the terminal.
#-e: This option is specific to the echo command in certain Unix-like systems (like Linux). It enables the interpretation of backslash escapes. In this case, it allows the use of \n to represent a newline character.
#The | (pipe) symbol at the end of the command is used to redirect the output of the echo command as input to another command. In the context of your question, it seems like the output is being piped into another command or process, likely for further processing or manipulation.
#example of using echo to put data into a path

echo -e "1,John Doe,50000\n2,Jane Smith,60000\n3,Bob Johnson,55000" | hadoop fs -put - /user/hive/warehouse/employees/employees.txt

#example of directly uploading a txt file to put data into a path, you have to create the file and put the data inside
#example: 1,John Doe,50000
#2,Jane Smith,60000
#3,Bob Johnson,55000
hadoop fs -put /path/to/local/employees.txt /user/hive/warehouse/employees/

#ATTENTION you have to use this command to load the data in the path to the actual table
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/warehouse/employees/employees.txt' INTO TABLE employees;


SELECT * FROM employees;
